# A fun project for a new way to read xkcd comics

Loads random xkcd comics and allows for infinite scroll. jump to any # comic.

Built with React, Redux, Tailwind. 

Originally using the xkcd API but switched to local storage after CORS was causing issues.

Future functionality for "recaptioning" and "favoriting".
